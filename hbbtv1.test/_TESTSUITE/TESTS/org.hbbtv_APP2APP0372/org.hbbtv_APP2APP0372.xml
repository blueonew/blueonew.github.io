            When either client sends a WebSocket message, consisting of one or more protocol frames, the terminal, upon receipt of each frame, shall immediately relay its contents to the other client via the corresponding WebSocket connection and maintaining the same payload type. [...] Over a 10 second period, during which any other paired connections have no traffic, the terminal shall be able to relay any of the following rates of traffic across a single paired connection: [...] * 10 unfragmented messages with a payload size of up to and including 131 072 bytes sent by the client connected to the remote service end-point.

        After the connections to the app2app service end-point of an HbbTV application and a companion screen application have been paired, the companion screen application sends a binary message with a size of 131 072 bytes using unfragmented frames every second for a duration of at least 60 seconds and the terminal shall immediately relay the frames and deliver all contained messages to the HbbTV application.

        After the HbbTV application and companion screen application were paired via the app2app service, all of the messages sent by the companion screen application were successfully and correctly relayed to the HbbTV application when the companion screen application sent a binary message with a size of 131 072 bytes using unfragmented frames every second for a duration of at least 60 seconds.
